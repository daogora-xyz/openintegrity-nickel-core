# BIP-Keychain

**Source**: https://github.com/akarve/bip-keychain
**Date Discovered**: 2025-10-21
**Relevance**: Semantic key derivation for cryptographic secrets - potentially applicable to hierarchical trust and key management in OpenIntegrity work streams

## Summary

BIP-Keychain is a draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal that extends BIP-85 (Deterministic Entropy From BIP32 Keychains) with semantic derivation paths. It creates a hierarchical key-value store where keys are meaningful semantic paths derived from JSON-LD schema.org entities, and values are cryptographic secrets.

The key innovation: **separating "derivation path keys" from "derivation path values"** to prevent cascading compromise - if the hot master is compromised, only the paths (not the actual secrets) are exposed.

## Key Features

### 1. Semantic Path Derivation

Uses JSON-LD formatted schema.org entities as derivation path segments:

```
m/83696968'/67797668'/{SEMANTIC_PATH_IMAGE}
```

- `83696968'` = BIP-85 prefix
- `67797668'` = BIP-Keychain application code
- `{SEMANTIC_PATH_IMAGE}` = Semantic path converted to numeric indices via HMAC-SHA-512

### 2. Separation of Keys and Values

**Traditional approach** (single master key):
```
Master Seed ‚Üí All Secrets
    ‚Üì (if compromised)
Everything lost
```

**BIP-Keychain approach**:
```
Master Seed ‚Üí Derivation Paths (metadata)
Cold Storage Key ‚Üí Actual Secrets
    ‚Üì (if hot master compromised)
Only paths exposed, secrets remain safe
```

### 3. Long Path Support

Handles derivation paths with potentially **thousands of segments**, enabling fine-grained hierarchical organization.

### 4. Flexible Hardening

Relaxes BIP-85's requirement for fully hardened derivation to enable **PKI use cases** (public key infrastructure).

### 5. Just-in-Time Secret Delivery

Secrets can be provided by a server-side key derivation service without storing the master key online.

## Technical Architecture

### Path Derivation Algorithm

1. **Input**: JSON-LD entity (e.g., website, location, organization)
2. **HMAC-SHA-512**: Hash entity with parent entropy as key
3. **Convert to index**: First 4 bytes ‚Üí uint32 child index
4. **BIP-32 derivation**: Derive child key at that index
5. **Repeat**: For each segment in semantic path

### Example: Web Password Derivation

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebSite",
  "url": "https://example.com"
}
```

Becomes derivation path:
```
m/83696968'/67797668'/2891336107'/...
```

The final secret is deterministically derived but path has semantic meaning.

## Insights for OpenIntegrity

### What We Learned

1. **Hierarchical secrets management**: BIP-32 can organize more than just Bitcoin keys
2. **Semantic paths**: Human-readable structure maps to cryptographic derivation
3. **Progressive disclosure**: Can reveal path structure without revealing secrets
4. **Schema.org integration**: Standardized entities enable interoperability

### What Surprised Us

- Separation of path keys vs. value keys (security property)
- Long path support (thousands of segments)
- JSON-LD as derivation input (semantic web meets crypto)
- PKI compatibility (non-hardened derivation)

## Potential Applications in OpenIntegrity

### 1. Hierarchical Repository Trust

```
m/83696968'/67797668'/
  ‚îú‚îÄ {github.com}/{org}/{repo}/ ‚Üí Repository identity key
  ‚îú‚îÄ {github.com}/{org}/{repo}/inception ‚Üí Inception commit signing key
  ‚îú‚îÄ {github.com}/{org}/{repo}/maintainers/{alice} ‚Üí Delegated authority key
  ‚îî‚îÄ {github.com}/{org}/{repo}/maintainers/{bob} ‚Üí Delegated authority key
```

### 2. Work Stream Key Derivation

```nickel
{
  key_derivation = {
    method = 'bip_keychain,

    base_path = "m/83696968'/67797668'",

    # Semantic path structure
    semantic_path = {
      platform = "github.com",
      organization = "OpenIntegrityProject",
      repository = "core",
      work_stream = "feature/hardware-signing",
    },

    # Derived keys
    signing_key | String,  # For commits
    verification_key | String,  # Public key
  },
}
```

### 3. Progressive Trust with Semantic Paths

Map OpenIntegrity trust phases to derivation paths:

```
m/.../repo/inception_authority ‚Üí Initial trust anchor
m/.../repo/delegated_authority/{maintainer} ‚Üí Delegated keys
m/.../repo/distributed_authority/{contributor} ‚Üí Contributor keys
m/.../repo/autonomous_authority/{bot} ‚Üí Automated signing
```

### 4. Cryptographic Proof of Path

Since paths are deterministically derived from semantic entities:
- Can prove a key belongs to a specific repository/work stream
- Can verify hierarchical relationships
- Can audit key structure without exposing secrets

## Code Examples

### Semantic Path to BIP-32 Derivation

```python
import hmac
import hashlib
import json

def semantic_path_to_index(json_ld_entity, parent_entropy):
    """Convert JSON-LD entity to BIP-32 child index."""
    # Serialize entity
    entity_bytes = json.dumps(json_ld_entity, sort_keys=True).encode()

    # HMAC with parent entropy
    h = hmac.new(parent_entropy, entity_bytes, hashlib.sha512)

    # First 4 bytes as uint32
    index = int.from_bytes(h.digest()[:4], 'big')

    return index

# Example: Repository identity
repo_entity = {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "SoftwareSourceCode",
    "codeRepository": "https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core"
}

index = semantic_path_to_index(repo_entity, parent_entropy)
# Derive child at m/83696968'/67797668'/{index}'
```

### Nickel Schema for BIP-Keychain Paths

```nickel
{
  bip_keychain_config = {
    base_path = "m/83696968'/67797668'",

    # Repository identity
    repository = {
      "@context" = "https://schema.org",
      "@type" = "SoftwareSourceCode",
      codeRepository | String,
    },

    # Derived keys
    keys = {
      inception_key = {
        path_suffix = "/inception",
        purpose = "Sign inception commit",
        hardened = true,
      },

      work_stream_key = {
        path_suffix = "/work-streams/{name}",
        purpose = "Sign work stream commits",
        hardened = true,
      },
    },
  },
}
```
