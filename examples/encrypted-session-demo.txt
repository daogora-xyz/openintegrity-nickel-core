OpenIntegrity Nickel Core - Session Demo
=========================================

This is an example agent session that demonstrates the encryption feature.

Session Context:
- Working on: Feature implementation for encrypted repository content
- Agent: Claude Code
- Date: 2025-01-21
- Status: Planning phase

Conversation Summary:
---------------------

User: I would like to add a feature that doesn't exist in the original reference
implementation. I'd like each repo to be able to keep encrypt repository content,
such as agent session data, so that conversations can be picked up but also kept
private while being stored in public repositories.
